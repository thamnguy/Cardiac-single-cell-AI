# Cardiac-single-cell-AI
This repository has the source code in the manuscript 'Analysis of Cardiac Single-cell RNA-sequencing Data Can be Improved by the Use of Artificial-Intelligence-based Tools', submitted to Scientific Report
The pipeline structure is complex, including many files and large data. Github appears to be inefficient to host them. Therefore, please download the pipeline codes and tutorial example at https://uab.box.com/s/0g6r0mauohupfi5e6upxuj3sd7xcfvs6. The tutorial page is hosted in Jay Zhang lab website: https://sites.uab.edu/jayzhanglab/products/ai-pipeline/

The codes are tested in the following environment
- R version 4.0.3, install Seurat
- Matlab version 2021, including Matlabâ€™s Neural Network, Deep Learning, and Statistics & Machine Learning toolboxes. Also, the pipeline uses Matlab UMAP https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71902-uniform-manifold-approximation-and-projection-umap
